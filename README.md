# Notes on Theory of Computation, Computability, and Complexity

These notes cover topics commonly taught in an undergraduate theory of computation or complexity theory course. They are loosely based on the lectures from CSC463 at the University of Toronto. I also consulted various sources when making those notes. See more in the bibliography section of the notes.

## Topics Covered

The notes roughly cover the following topics:

- Language and automaton theory
- Computability
- Computational complexity

To understand the materials, one should be familiar with basic theory of computation, including proofs, formal language theory, big-O notation, correctness proof, and complexity analysis.

You are welcome to check out my notes on theory of computation, data structures and algorithms. I may occasionally refer to those notes as well.

## Accuracy

I will try my best to ensure the accuracy of the contents. However, unlike my previous notes on data structure and theory of computation, these notes contain some personal opinions and interpretations that could be inaccurate or outright erroneous. If you find any errors, please let me know.

There are a lot of proofs in the notes. For most of them, the proof that I presented is not the only valid proof. There could be multiple valid ways to prove the same thing. But if you do believe that I made an error in one of the proofs, let me know too.

## Using these notes

Feel free to use these notes as reference, but if you are taking CSC463 or any other complexity or theory of computation courses at other universities, I still highly recommend that you keep your own notes. These notes should be a companion of your notes, not a substitute. These notes closely followed the course structure of CSC463 as well as the book Introduction to the Theory of Computation, 3rd Edition, by Michael Sipser.

## Contribute

These notes are still very much a work in progress. I aim to finish them by the summer of 2022. Any contribution is appreciated. If you want to contribute: edit, improve, or add new contents, feel free to chime in at any time. Please make sure to cite your sources as necessary.
